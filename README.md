# TrajView
Python applet for handling molecular trajectories

TrajView which is a molecular trajectory viewer application which utilizes Voila, IPython, PyPlot, NumPy and ASE. 
This allows the user to view ASE readable molecular trajectories (traj, xyz, pdb, cif, among others). 

The application window also displays energies and forces during the trajectory. 
TrajView includes a molecular property plotting tool. 
This allows the use to plot bonds, angles, and dihedrals. 
Additionally, the plotted property is simultaneously visualized on the side. 

Data and image export is also possible.
